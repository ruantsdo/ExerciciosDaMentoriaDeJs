# BarberShop registration APP

This project was created to obtain approval in one of the subjects of my undergraduate course in information systems at UNEB Alagoinhas.   
The purpose of this project is to register barber shops on the platform.   
The project has a registration and login system using firebase and a database system to register, remove and edit the barber shop and user infos, also using firebase. 
The project has a location system to get your current location.
## Notices ⚠️

The functions of registration, user login and barber shop in this project may be inactive due to the pre-established time limit of firebase. In order for these functions to work normally, it is necessary to update the "firebase.js" file in the "services" folder with valid credentials of a properly configured firebase.
